# HR Attrition Analysis – Business Analytics Project

## Business Problem
Employee attrition creates operational disruption and increased hiring costs. The objective of this project is to analyse employee data, identify attrition drivers, and support data-driven workforce retention decisions.

## Dataset
- 1,470 employee records
- Structured HR dataset including demographics, job role, performance, compensation, and tenure
- Dataset used for academic business analytics project

## Analytical Approach
- Data cleaning and validation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Regression and classification modelling
- Insight interpretation and business recommendations
- Dashboard-based visualisation for decision support

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (data extraction and querying)
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- R (statistical modelling)
- Power BI (dashboard visualisation)

## Key Insights
- Predictive model achieved 78% accuracy in identifying attrition risk
- Identified key factors influencing employee attrition
- Highlighted high-risk employee segments for proactive intervention

## Business Impact
This analysis demonstrates how business analytics and predictive modelling can be applied to anticipate employee attrition and support strategic workforce planning and retention initiatives.

## Repository Structure
- `/notebooks` – Data analysis and modelling notebooks
- `/visuals` – Charts and dashboard screenshots
- `/data` – Dataset description (data not publicly shared)

## Notes
This project focuses on business decision support rather than model optimisation and reflects an applied analytics use case.
